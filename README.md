### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Joe

#### Software developer, author, public speaker

I love solving puzzles, always have. I am one of the fortunate few who has been able to turn their passion into a profession. As a software developer I absolutely love to solve complex problems with elegant and fast solutions. I firmly believe that it is my job to use those skills to make people's lives easier. If I can write software that makes peoples jobs easier and makes their day go faster then I have met my goal. 

I also really love learning new things, especially about technology. As an example, at U-Haul I had to take over a piece of software that was critical to the company when one of the developers left. The software was written in 3 languages. I already knew C# but I had to teach myself D and C++ as well. Quite a challenge but I thrived on it. That's just the kind of stuff I do.

I really enjoy teaching too, whether it be speaking or writing. I used to be an MCT and I've had several books published, authored a number of video courses and spoken at a variety of conferences in front of hundreds of people. If I get the opportunity to teach or help someone learn something new, I take it.
